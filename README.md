## How to Play
In Roach Mommy's Fish Fry, your goal is to guess the hidden word before Roach Mommy fries your friend in a pot. To guess the word, you must select a letter from the alphabet, and if the letter is in the word, it will be revealed. If the letter is not in the word, a part of your friend's body will be added to the pot.

You can only guess a limited number of incorrect letters before your friend is fully added to the pot and you lose the game. To win the game, you must guess all the letters in the word before your friend is fully added to the pot.
